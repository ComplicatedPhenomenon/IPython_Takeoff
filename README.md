## Good usage of notebooks:

    Another really exciting thing is what O'Reilly Media is doing. They are
    embracing the notebook at a fairly deep level.The first is they have this
    new learning site.Along with this actual website, O'Reilly has this open
    source project called [thebe](https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe)

    When I first saw this, I think part of my response was "wow, that's a little
    bit like over kill me maybe"when you think about it, how much worse is it?
    Some one will publish article requiring this much analysis and leave that
    analysis out, there is no way anyone would ever be able to reproduce that
    work.
    [BuzzFeed are doing fantastic work](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/everything#libraries-and-tools)
    They had committed to do this for all of their data driven articles, they
    are not sort of after the fact making sort decisions about "well, should we
    open this or not",they just said "we are doing it for everything".

## Create Virtual Environment for every project

For Example, In this repo., we installed several packages with a definite version along the way.
Abot which version of software and package will you use. If it concerns more than one version, then
you need to create Virtual Environment for every project.


## Forward

From `Quora`
> Start at a level you understand, and gradually increase the complexity of the problems you are solving and the systems you are building.

> Don't let yourself distracted by all the vanity. If you get shit done and can find someone who will pay you for it, you're at the best level of programming as far as I'm concerning.

The concepts become more abstract, with architecture more complex, programming makes good efficiency and contain more deep condense intelligence, meanwhile, leaving a long way for newbies, it is far away from experience-thinking


You have seen that people explain or depict a thing by including the complete features, not instead of listing some features which you think are important.
