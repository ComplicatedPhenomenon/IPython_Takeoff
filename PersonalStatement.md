I got great interests in theoretical Physics since I was at high school, I thought life should be
fulfill with something has eternal meaning, I determined that pursuing after to comprehend the law
behind the physical world is my choice, At that time, I was at home alone, and Physics made me 
full of passion and joy. At the beginning,I was inspired by the work for lay readers, 
like Gerard't Hooft's webpage of 'How to be a good physicist', Franck Wilczek's 'The lightness of being' 
and Kip Thorne's 'Black Holes and Time Warps'.

After my professional education path toward Physics begin, I dive into the world of Physics, I take the 
ahead of others to adapt to my rhythm. I self-educated lot of physics, meanwhile, I got to know I should
embark on this journey in a right way. In order to get rid of the dangerous of being a dilettante, I keep 
the habit of discussing the concepts hard to comprehend with my teacher and some of my classmate from time to time. 

When I learn something, I reproduce it by myself, After manually deducing the most part of the textbook 
'Gravitation and Cosmology' by Steven Weinberg in my sophomore year, I got the confidence in figuring the
deep physics.

At the first year in graduate school, Not only taking the class arranged in my school, but also I went to other school
to study the courses provided more thing about quantum field theory. 


At the second year in graduate study, I was fall in love with programming, when I learned the some software and 
libraries written by physicist, e.g. Cadabra, FeynCalc, and MadGraph,  I was touched by their work of making other
people get rid of the laborious work,Seeing from a certain way, it is repeated work. As we already did it too many times,
we are very familiar with the routine way and techniques in our calculation process. The with the aid of programming,
we have much energy to focus on the real physics. So I will sharp my programming skill to implement the calculations
in theoretical Physics.
