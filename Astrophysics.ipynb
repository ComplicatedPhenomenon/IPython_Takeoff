    "Machine learning could also influence how we interpret exoplanet signals. For example, we could train software with detailed physical models of a variety of exoplanet types, giving it the objective to predict the composition of planetary atmospheres. This could identify targets for more detailed modelling and follow-up observations. However, it will be a while before we have enough detailed observations of exoplanet atmospheres to require such a system.\n",

    "* One is simply that many astronomers (myself included) are not formally trained in statistics and machine learning techniques, and this can mean there is a bit of reluctance to make use of machine learning, especially in areas where traditional techniques still appear to work.\n",
    "* Another is that, as well as requiring expertise outside of traditional astronomy, machine learning applied to large data sets requires large computational-resources, which can be difficult to access.\n",
    "* A final problem is to do with the interpretation of the results from machine learning. Complex deep-learning algorithms can outperform humans, which could give fascinating insights. But without understanding the connections made that lead to their results, what new physical insight do we learn in the process? What conclusions could we really draw?\n",
