    "The program and its auxiliary modules will be packaged and saved on a \n",

    "0. **Package functionality**\n",
    "    * The code can be installed from anaconda repository and it able to start\n",
    "    with minimal functionality (i.e. the GUI starts and at least a task works).\n",

    "3. **Robustness**\n",
    "    * The code should be ideally free of bugs and every single task should work.\n",

    "    * Evaluation of how the code is written. \n",

    "      more readable ? Is the code well organized ?\n",
    "    * 10% of total note\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation**\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Presentation**\n",
    "    * Accurate description of the code should accompaign the package in the git repository in form of a Readme file.\n",
    "    * Oral presentation of the code describing the objective of the code and how it works.\n",
