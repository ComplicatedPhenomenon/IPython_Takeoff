In the area of theoretical physics,  **ML**  cares little about physical principals. The virtue of this method come in this way. You just find it has low effciency in calculating something in a traditional way, where you construct a model from real event directly, then after got some reliable data to the machine for learning, then the machine is capable to predict the outcome, ideally, which is very close to the result by using routine program. However, this method involve nothing with physics. So, physicist still need to solve their problems on their own. \n",

You can play with the phone doesn't mean you know much about it. If you are using the computational framework, but know little about how the function is implemented, then you can do little with it. You cannot develop it even it is very extennsible. "
